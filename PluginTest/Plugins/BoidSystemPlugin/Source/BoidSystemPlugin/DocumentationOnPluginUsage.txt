This plugin provides a complex system which dives into the world of Boids. The system is created with the plan to make 
the code as understandable as possible. This plugin can be edited in various ways which is what is going to be discussed
here with other topics which may interest you(Le User).

(PS, this is my first project inside of Unreal Engine, the code may be rudimentary and  at times slightly hard to read.
I have done my best to simplify and write what each function does.)

Version 1.0
